            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The elephant beetle is a large and impressive insect belonging to the scarab beetle family. 
                Known for their size and strength, these beetles are native to Central and South America and are primarily nocturnal.

            <p>
                Male elephant beetles are characterized by their long, curved horns, which they use during fights for dominance. 
                Their shiny, black exoskeleton provides protection, while their large size—up to 12 cm—makes them one of the largest beetles in the world.

            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>
                Elephant beetles primarily feed on decaying plant matter and fruit. 
                Their diet plays a significant role in the ecosystem, as they help decompose organic material and recycle nutrients into the soil.

            <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
            <p>
                The life cycle of an elephant beetle begins as a larva, which can grow to an impressive size while feeding on decomposing wood. 
                After months of development, the larva pupates and emerges as an adult beetle, ready to continue its role in the ecosystem.

            <h2 id="physical_traits">Behavior and Habitat</h2>
            <p>
                Elephant beetles are generally solitary and can be found in tropical forests. 
                They are most active at night and are attracted to light, often seen near homes and gardens in their native regions.
