            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The silk moth, or Bombyx mori, is a remarkable insect known for its role in producing silk, a luxurious and durable fiber. 
                Domesticated for thousands of years, the silk moth has become a symbol of human ingenuity and natural beauty.

                Silk moths are medium-sized insects with creamy white wings and a soft, furry body. 
                Their wings have subtle patterns that blend well with their environment. 
                As adults, they are unable to eat and live only for about a week to reproduce.

            <p>
                Silk moths are best known for the silk they produce during their larval stage. 
                The larvae, called silkworms, spin silk cocoons to protect themselves during metamorphosis. 
                These cocoons are carefully harvested to extract the silk fibers, which are then spun into thread.

            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Silk moths have been fully domesticated and rely on humans for survival. 
                They are no longer capable of flight and have a short lifespan dedicated entirely to mating and laying eggs. 
                The larvae, however, are voracious feeders, consuming large quantities of mulberry leaves.

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>
                While wild silk moths still exist, Bombyx mori is a domesticated species raised in controlled environments. 
                These moths thrive in silk farms, where they are provided with optimal conditions for cocoon production.
