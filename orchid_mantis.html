            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The orchid mantis (Hymenopus coronatus) is a stunning insect renowned for its mimicry of orchid flowers. 
                This remarkable camouflage helps it both avoid predators and ambush prey. Found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, the orchid mantis is a master of disguise.

            <p>
                The orchid mantis is known for its bright white and pink coloration, which closely resembles the petals of an orchid. 
                Its legs are shaped like flower petals, enhancing its ability to blend seamlessly into its environment. This mimicry makes it one of the most beautiful and fascinating insects in the world.

            <h2 id="camouflage">Camouflage and Hunting</h2>
            <p>
                The orchid mantis uses its flower-like appearance to lure unsuspecting insects, such as butterflies and bees, within striking range. 
                Unlike most mantises, it does not wait on actual flowers but relies solely on its mimicry to attract prey. 
                This adaptation is a prime example of nature's ingenuity.

            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Orchid mantises are solitary creatures that spend most of their lives hunting and hiding. 
                They are ambush predators, remaining motionless until the perfect moment to strike. 
                Despite their delicate appearance, they are highly efficient hunters.
