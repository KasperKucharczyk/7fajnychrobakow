            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Leaf cutter ants are remarkable insects known for their ability to cut and carry pieces of leaves many times their size. 
                They belong to the genera Atta and Acromyrmex and are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.

            <p>
                Leaf cutter ants are easily recognized by their industrious nature and teamwork. 
                Workers of different sizes perform specific roles, from cutting leaves to defending the colony. 
                Their jaws are powerful enough to slice through tough plant material with ease.

            <p>
                Leaf cutter ant colonies are highly organized, with millions of ants working together. 
                The colony includes workers, soldiers, and a single queen responsible for laying eggs. 
                Each ant performs specialized tasks to ensure the survival and success of the colony.

            <h2>Agriculture</h2>
            <p>
                These ants are famous for their unique form of agriculture. They cut leaves and bring them back to their nests, where the plant material is used to cultivate a specific type of fungus. 
                This fungus serves as their primary food source, making them one of the few animals to practice farming.

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>
                Leaf cutter ants are found in forests and grasslands, where they play an essential role in the ecosystem. 
                By cutting leaves and transporting them, they help with plant pruning and nutrient cycling, maintaining the health of their environment.
