            <p>
                These spiders are easily recognized by their large front-facing eyes and compact bodies. 
                Unlike many spiders that rely on webs to catch prey, jumping spiders are active hunters. 
                They use their powerful legs to pounce on unsuspecting insects, often leaping many times their body length to catch their meal.

            <h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Jumping spiders have some of the best vision among arthropods. 
                Their four pairs of eyes are specially adapted to detect movement and judge distances, making them excellent hunters. 
                This exceptional vision also plays a role in their courtship displays, where males perform intricate dances to attract mates.
