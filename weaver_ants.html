            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Weaver ants, belonging to the genus Oecophylla, are famous for their unique ability to build nests out of living leaves. 
                These ants are highly social insects, known for their impressive teamwork and advanced colony structures. 
                They are primarily found in tropical forests of Africa and Asia.

            <p>
                Weaver ants are medium-sized ants with a slender body and a reddish or orange coloration. 
                Their strong legs and mandibles are perfectly adapted for climbing and manipulating leaves during nest construction.

            <p>
                Weaver ants are best known for their ingenious nests, which they create by stitching together leaves using silk produced by their larvae. 
                Worker ants hold leaves in place while others transport the larvae, using the silk to bond the leaves together. 
                These nests are sturdy and serve as excellent shelters for the colony.

            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Weaver ants are highly territorial and defend their nests aggressively. 
                They are active predators, feeding on a variety of small insects and arthropods. 
                They also engage in mutualistic relationships with certain plants, protecting them from pests in exchange for nectar.

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>
                These ants thrive in tropical forests and are often found in trees where they construct their leaf-based nests. 
                Their colonies can span several trees, creating a network of interconnected nests.
